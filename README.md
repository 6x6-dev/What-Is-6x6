# What-Is-6x6

6 weeks, 6 projects. 

  The goal is to learn development skills in a way that almost everyone agrees is the 'right' way to learn. Anyone asking for 'how to learn x' has seen the response 'just build things'. That however falls short in many ways. Not everyone has the initiative to go off and do that. Or the motivation to continue on their own. So projects like #100daysofcode have been very successful in giving developers a community, some accountability, and by proxy motivation to continue learning. This approach is inspired by 100 days of code, but attempts to fill in some gaps. 100 days is a commitment to spend at least an hour a day writing code. But there is no other direction. Each week in a 6x6 program you will take on a project, with guidelines, requirements, and a group of teammates who are working on the mase project. Each team member is responsible for their own project and at the end of the week you review eachothers work. This addresses something that is missing from 100, the need in development to communicate your decisions and take/give criticism is very real and as important as being able to 'make it work'. 

## Why 6?

8 is too long to commit to, 4 isnt really enough. 6 weeks is roughly half 100 days, but this requires a higher level of accountability. 

## What is the structure?

### Init
A group, say 6 people, decide to make a commitment to do this program. The have an initial meeting to plan which projects they will take on. This is the time to ensure everyone has the skill level necessary to take on these tasks, make a schedule of when meetings will take place, and select a rotation for review.

### Work
Individuals will spend a week building their projects independently. A place to communicate should be available to ask for help should be available through [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/6by6/) or [discord](https://discord.gg/KMzM9br). At the end of the week, users should make a PR in the project repo with their work.

### Review
Once all the PRs are in, users should submit a written review on their assigned user for this rotation. This requires **unconditional positive regard**. No one signs up for this to have their code shit on, so dont be an asshole. With that in mind if youre strugging to find issues to review the goal isnt always to find something wrong, this is the time to ask questions about the code your reading. If you dont understand a decision or implementation details, ask. Each use should _at least_ review their assigned peer, if there is time and motivation to review more feel free.

The written reviews should be done before a video conference where each person presents their work, and the group then has a chance to review and discuss. This is the time where communication about decisions is key. **Talking about code** is as important as writing it. 

### Repeat
Now you have to move on. this isnt about iteration. This is about getting the nuggets of learning and applying them in the next project. Going over the same code repeatedly can become boring. Move on!

## How to join
through [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/6by6/) or [discord](https://discord.gg/KMzM9br), or feel free to start your own. This is only meant to act as a framework.
